# FraudDetection
Logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to predict fraudulent transactions by training it on Kaggle dataset

1) Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data and place it in ieee-fraud-detection folder.

2) Follow the jupyter notebook for the instructions and explaination. First we are analysing the features of the data by printing the data analysis and also with the help of graph. Next we use the Logistic regression model to predict and generate the sample_submission.csv file to display the prediction for each transaction ID from the test data set.
